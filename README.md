# SwiftUI Animations

Hi! This is a repository where i publish code for the animations you see on my [Instagram (@InnAppsCoding)](https://www.instagram.com/innappscoding/)  
I'm a iOS developer learning Swift and SwiftUI. I create and post animations for fun and to show people how easy it is to create animations in SwiftUI!  
I'm not a UX or UI designer, so use what i post as inspiration and a learning resource for creating animations with SwiftUI! I can't guarantee that all my creations would have passed Apples guidelines ðŸ˜‚  ðŸ˜‚
